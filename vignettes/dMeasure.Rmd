# Create a dMeasure object

```{r setup}
library(dMeasure)

a <- dMeasure$new() # creates an dMeasure object named 'a'. Could be named something else.
```

# Configuration file location

The location of the .sqlite file is stored in ""~/.DailyMeasure_cfg.yaml"

The .sqlite file contains information required to access the Best Practice database.
By default, the .sqlite file location is "~/.DailyMeasure_cfg.sqlite"

```{r config_file_path_default}
a$configuration_file_path

```

But the location of the .sqlite file can be changed.
If the specified file does not exist, the file will be created.

```{r}
a$configuration_file_path <- "~/.MySpecialConfig.sqlite"
a$configuration_file_path
```
